# Project Overview
This is a guide to navigating our pilot project assigned through our *Data Visualization & Analytics Boot Camp*. Our class was 
divided into teams and tasked with selecting a topic of interest and finding a robust enough data set to--**ask questions**, **explore**, 
**clean**, **analyze**, and **present upon**--using the new tools and skills we've acquired in just **under 3 months** time!

## CRASH! Data Set
Our group chose to investigate **factors that contribute to the frequency of fatal car accidents in the United States.**
