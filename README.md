#Traffic Fatality/Accident Analysis

##Background
    Thousands of accidents happen every year while people are driving. Some of those are fatal and cause severe harm to people involved, sometimes resulting in their death. Fatality In this project, we tried to analysis fatality data across the United States and identify most significant factors that contribute to these dangerous incidents.

##Data Analysis Approach
	We analyzed our data based on below categories and wrote down some questions for each. 
	•Time
	Do fatalities have a correlation to day of the week, month or time of day?
	•Personal factors
	Do personal factors such as drunk driving, age, distracted driving have impact on fatalities? 
	•Weather
	Do more fatalities occur during winter months when the road conditions are worse?
	•Location
	Do more accidents occur in urban area vs rural?

##DataSet
	•Fatality Analysis Reporting System(FARS)
	FARS is a nationwide census providing NHTSA, Congress and the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.
	
	•National Automotive Sampling System(NASS)
	General Estimates System(GES) data from NASS focuses on the bigger overall crash picture, and are used for problem size assessments and tracking trends.

	Data derived from these two system consists of below information.
	1.Accident
	2.Vehicle
	3.Person
